title: Participating in HackUIowa's Hackathon 2023
---

On Septemer 23, 2023, the University of Iowa's HackUIowa put on their annual hackathon event. One of my good friends, Amy, and I decided to form a team of two and hack together for the weekend. We were both incredibly busy with assignments and an exam in one of our shared classes, however, we were both determined to gain some experience and participate in the hackathon anyway. 

Amy and I established some foundaitonal rules for ourselves to make sure we were: 
1. Fair to other hackathon competitors 
2. Allocated enough time to study for our exam 
3. Learn a new skill
