### More Information

Hello! My name is Michelle and I'm pursuing my second B.A. in Computer Science at the University of Iowa. I graduated in May 2022 with a B.A. in International Studies in hopes of pursing a J.D. and a legal career. After my internship on Capital Hill in the U.S. House of Representatives in the summer of 2022, I reflected more on my academic and career goals. I intended to take a gap year prior to starting law school after my internship. I had the opportunity to meet some amazing individuals who introduced me to the world of tech. After a brief introduction in coding from CodeAcademy, I re-enrolled to the University of Iowa for computer science. I am interested in intersecting computer science with social issues, and health and wellness in hopes of making technology more equitable, accessible, and inclusive for all. I am excited about my new academic and career journey. Follow along to see what projects I've been working on!
