### Meet Michelle!

Hi there! I'm Michelle, a computer science student at the University of Iowa and I'm passionate about developing technology that actively promotes and enhances accessibility, equity, and diversity for all. 

In this digital age, leveraging our keen technological knowledge and advancements the key to creating positive change and improving our future. I feel privileged to be a part of a research lab at the University of Iowa, where I have the opportunity to witness the intersection of technology and other sectors in the pursuit of enhancing the well-being of others. 

Over the past 9 months, I have equipped myself with foundational computer science courses and experiential learning opportunities. These experiences have provided me with a solid grasp of programming languages and a fruitful introduction to the world of technology and software development. 

Historically, the tech industry has been male and white dominated and with many gender and racial disparities. I hope to be a part of the movement to lead the world of technology into a more inclusive, empowering, and safe space, especially for women of color (WOC).

Follow along and stay tuened to see the projects I've been passionately developing and the exciting discoveries I make in my on-going tech journey!
